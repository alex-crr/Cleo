The idea behind this system is to replicate an AI assistant similar to Jarvis.
I have been using second brain systems like notion and wanted to see if it was possible to get a system that would allow it to interact with a database for it's context, theoretically saving a bit on complexity.
The project hasnt been completely defined/refined yet but the more I buiild upon it, the clearer it becomes.
 
## files walkthrough
### LLM personalization
There is a provided `Jarvis.modelfile` that allows you to change how your LLM behaves, from which model it bases itself, ...
To create your new model you may run the file `Model personalizer.py`

### DB creation
the file `DB_setup.sql` allows you to create a similar sql database as the one i am currently using
